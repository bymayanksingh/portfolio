#### Hey there üëã welcome to my first blog ‚ù§

##### This little space I own in the world wide web is pretty much in it's infancy, I have some plans for this portfolio/blog going forward the coming year, sharing some of them here.

- I plan to add more of my projects in the [/projects](/projects) route, I'll have to categorize them into `Backend/ Frontend/ Full Stack/ Games /Snippets etc.` & implement releavant filters to improve user experience. 

- I'll add support for dark mode on this portfolio eventually.

- I'll add a new route where I'll share my book reading list as well, I'll share little synopsis/major learnings from the books I have read, so that even the world can get value out of that list.

- I'll share the entire process on how I built some of my existing as well my future projects. 

- I'll try to be more consistent with blog writing, where I'll be sharing my daily technological as well as intellectual learnings, basically I'll try to use this place a journal.

- I'll also share some of my existing/future graphic designs.

- I'll be integrating disqus comment system into my blog. 


##### This blog/portfolio is possible because of [neat-starter](https://github.com/surjithctly/neat-starter) template provided by [@surjithctly](https://github.com/surjithctly)

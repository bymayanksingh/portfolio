#### Hey there üëã welcome to my first blog ‚ù§

##### This little space I own in the world wide web is pretty much in it's infant stage, I plan a lot going forward this new year (2021) sharing some of my goals here.

- I plan to add more of my projects in the [/projects](/projects) route, I'll even categorize them into `Backend/ Frontend/ Full Stack/ Games /Snippets etc.` & implement releavant filters to improve user experience. 

- I'll add support for dark mode on this portfolio of mine.

- I'll add a new route where I'll share my reading list as well, I'll share little synopsis/major learnings on all the books, so that even the world can get value out of that list.

- I'll share the entire process on how I built some of my existing and future projects. 

- I'll try to be more consistent with blog writing where I'll share my daily technological as well as intellectual learnings, basically I'll use this place a journal.

- I'll also share some of my designs which I already have designed or will design in the coming future.


##### This blog/portfolio is possible because of [neat-starter](https://github.com/surjithctly/neat-starter) template provided by [@surjithctly](https://github.com/surjithctly)
